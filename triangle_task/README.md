# Area of curved triangle

This program:
1. Calculates the area of a curved triangle using the bisection method for finding the roots, as well as the method of calculating a definite integral by the trapezoid formula. It also draws graphs of functions in the Cartesian coordinate system.
Root search ranges are set by condition.

1. Found integration limits using the bisection method
2. Use Trapezoid formula to calculate a definite integral
3. Calculates area of curved triangles using valuies of definite integrals
