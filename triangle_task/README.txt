This program calculates the area of a curved triangle using the bisection method for finding the roots, as well as the method of calculating a definite integral by the trapezoid formula. It also draws graphs of functions in the Cartesian coordinate system.

P.S. The program does not localize the curvilinear triangle itself, but in order to find the roots, you yourself need to set the search range for the roots and the accuracy of finding them.
