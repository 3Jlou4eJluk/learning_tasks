This program calculates the area of a curved triangle using the bisection method for finding the roots, as well as the method of calculating a definite integral by the trapezoid formula. It also draws graphs of functions in the Cartesian coordinate system.

Usage:

1) Enter the left and right border of finding the intersection of f1 and f3 and the accuracy of its calculation
2) Enter the left and right border of finding the intersection of f2 and f3 and the accuracy of its calculation
3) Enter the left and right border of finding the intersection of f1 and f2 and the accuracy of its calculation
4) Enter the precision of the integral calculation and the initial partition
5) The program will calculate the area of a curvilinear triangle, find the intersection points of functions, and plot functions
6) P.S. The program does not localize the curvilinear triangle itself, but in order to find the roots, you yourself need to set the search range for the roots and the accuracy of finding them.

P.S.S. The problem was given to me by a teacher at Moscow State University
