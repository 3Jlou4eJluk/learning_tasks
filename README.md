# long_ariphmetics_adder-
A program for translating large numbers (up to 1000 characters long) from one number system (from 2 to 36) to another (from 2 to 36) and their addition.  

Usage:
1) Enter the "input" and "output" number system in the range from 2 to 36 
2) Enter two integers (no longer than 1000 characters) in the "input" number system(for number systems> 10, use the letters of the Latin alphabet to enter numbers)
3) The program will display their sum in the "output" number system. 

P.S. Full control of user input errors has been done, that's why there are so many lines of code
