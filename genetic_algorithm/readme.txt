The function(function F5(x: single): single;) is set in the genetic_task.pas module. Constants A, B, M are set in the types.pas module. The program searches for the maximum of the function on the segment A, B, which is discretized by 2 to the power of M points.

This genetic algorithm assumes the functions of selection, crossing and mutation.

P.S. Initially, it was supposed to be implemented in Pascal, but at the end of the second semester they were given the task to rewrite some procedures in assembler, 
which made it possible to perform these procedures on average 10 times faster.
