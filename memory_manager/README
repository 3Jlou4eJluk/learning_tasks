This is realisation of memory manager(membanks.c, membanks.h), which have 5 functions:
1) unsigned int alloc(unsigned int size) - allocates memory for a new block with specified size(returns current block's number)
2) void dealloc(unsigned int block_num) - deallocates block with specified number
3) void write_byte(unsigned int bank, unsigned int delta, char byte) - writes byte in specified block
4) char read_byte(unsigned int bank, unsigned int delta) - read byte from block
5) unsigned int reallocm(unsigned int bank, unsigned int size) - enlarge block
